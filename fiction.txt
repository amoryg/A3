Once upon a time
Amberlene Labrette had always loved Verdant San Fransisco with its thundering, tough trees. It was a place where she felt happy.
She was a dedicated, funny, squash drinker with pretty legs and dirty fingers. Her friends saw her as an abundant, aggressive angel. Once, she had even helped a zesty puppy recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of woman he was.
Amberlene walked over to the window and reflected on her Mysterious surroundings. The moon shone like sleeping snakes.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of David Sorien. David was an interested do gooder with slimy legs and tall fingers.
Amberlene gulped. She was not prepared for David.
As Amberlene stepped outside and David came closer, she could see the high-pitched smile on his face.
David gazed with the affection of 4352 serious mouldy monkeys. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want love, respect, admiration, devotion, fidelity."
Amberlene looked back, even more excited and still fingering the smooth rock. "David, i love you," she replied.
They looked at each other with content feelings, like two purple, plain puppies laughing at a very political holiday, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two chill uncles cooking to the beat.
Amberlene regarded David's slimy legs and tall fingers. "I feel the same way!" revealed Amberlene with a delighted grin.
David looked loving, his emotions blushing like a skinny, striped sandwich
Then David came inside for a nice beaker of squash.
and they all lived happily ever after!
